R can be used for more than just stats. You can use it for generating course materials, creating and grading multiple-choice tests, computer-assisted assessment, personalised exam feedback, and student websites. Shiny apps are also a powerful way to demonstrate statistical concepts. But R definitely isn't the only tool for reproducible research. We'll also discuss other tools for teaching reproducible research skills, such as the OSF, git, and GitHub.
